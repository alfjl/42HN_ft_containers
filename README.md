# 42HN_ft_containers

The main.cpp provided is only a limited test, to pass the eval of this project.
Besides this, I've tested my code with the following testers and mains (including running each main with valgrind on macOS, to check for leaks):

* [mli42 / containers_test](https://github.com/mli42/containers_test)
* [Mikastiv / ft_containers-terminator](https://github.com/Mikastiv/ft_containers-terminator) (including its benchmark tester)
* [the tester of fellow 42 Heilbronn peer Aktai0n](https://github.com/Aktai0n/ft_containers-42Heilbronn)
* [the main of fellow 42 Heilbronn peer JL1709](https://github.com/JL1709/ft_containers)
* [the main of fellow 42 Heilbronn peer ](https://github.com/JeremieSiller/ft_containers)
