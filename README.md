# 42HN_ft_containers

The goal of the **ft_containers** project is to reimplement some of the C++ STL containers, in order to get a deeper understanding on how they work.  
Additionally, since map and set include an implementation of a red-black tree, the second main goal of this project is to get a better understanding of different trees as data structures.  
As all C++ projects at the core curriculum of School 42, the students code has to comply with the C++98 standard.

## Description

## Learnings

## Testing

The main.cpp provided is only a limited test, to pass the evaluation guidelines of this project.
To make sure my code was working as sound as possible, I've tested my code with the following testers and mains (including running each main with valgrind on macOS, to check for leaks):

* [mli42 / containers_test](https://github.com/mli42/containers_test)
* [Mikastiv / ft_containers-terminator](https://github.com/Mikastiv/ft_containers-terminator) (including its benchmark tester)
* [the tester of fellow 42 Heilbronn peer Aktai0n](https://github.com/Aktai0n/ft_containers-42Heilbronn)
* [the main of fellow 42 Heilbronn peer JL1709](https://github.com/JL1709/ft_containers)
* [the main of fellow 42 Heilbronn peer JeremieSiller](https://github.com/JeremieSiller/ft_containers)

Being a school project and the first time for me to come in contact with the inner workings of the STL containers, I don't presume my implementation to be bulletproof.  
Thus, I'm very happy about every constructive feedback I can get!
